# Transfer learning-based layout inverse design of composite system for anticipated thermo-mechanical field
Dataset folder contains 1500 training samples, 400 validation samples, and 400 testing samples.
DL result folder contains the prediction accuracy metric (MA and MCR) with different training dataset size, which takes temperature field as input condition. 
TL result folder contains the prediction accuracy metric of 6 models, including different thermal conditions, material volume fraction, and larger scale.
