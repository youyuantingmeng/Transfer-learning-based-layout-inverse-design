# Transfer learning-based layout inverse design of composite system for anticipated thermo-mechanical field
Dataset comprising 1500 training samples, 400 validation samples, and 400 testing samples.
DL result contains the prediction accuracy metric (MA and MCR), which takes temperature field as input condition.
TL result contains the prediction accuracy metric of 6 models, including different thermal conditions, material volume fraction, and larger scale.
